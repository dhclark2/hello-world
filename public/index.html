    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

    <h2>Assignment Essay</h2>

      <p> Reading this article and some of the other pre-readings for this course have forced me to realize that I colloquially talk about the “internet” as one entity, however, when reading about the development of pages on the internet I subconsciously interpret the ecosystem as two separate beasts.  One beast is “the internet” as in the mechanism that connects us to all things that are also connected.  I need the internet to watch Netflix in 2016 and I needed the internet to enjoy playing Counter-Strike in 1999.  I am not even sure what part of speech is correct, i.e., the internet or just internet.  I guess I use the when describing a site or conceptual location and I just use internet to describe data transfer, for phones, etc.  The other beast is The Web, which I seem to associate with pages themselves, and perhaps their design.   </p>

      <p> The more I learn through the Iron Yard program will certainly clarify and distill what my “soul” has allowed my brain to believe versus what is technically correct.  I may be loosely describing real philosophies or labels, but I have no authority on the matter.   </p>

      <p> This is all a bit of an aside to the original prompt: describe my understanding of the evolution of the web, but the article certainly scratched my subconscious.  I don’t have strong feelings about the early days of the internet, or at least my early days (the 1990s).  While I hate data caps for mobile devices, I suppose it is the lesser of two evils when I consider that all browsers could still be the clusterf*** of American Online if there was no public outcry to limit the amount of data one is required to use due to cost.  I read somewhere that original testers for the Google search pages sometimes didn’t realize they could start “searching” because they were waiting for the page to finish loading.  AOL and other horrible creatures had trained many users to wait for the barrage of adds to finish loading or risk bogging down the browser.   </p>

      <p> I hope we do not slip back to such bombastic and cluttered advertising now that computers and mobile devices are so much more powerful.   </p>
